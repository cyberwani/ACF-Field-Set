# ACF Field Set

This is a plugin which adds a grouping option to ACF fields.  You can use it to group fields that go together, such as a URL and link text field.  This also works as a simplified version of conditional requirement.  In this example, adding a Link is optional, but if you add one, both the URL and link text will be required.

This concept is similar to a repeater field which doesn't allow for repitition.

It does not currently support ACF version 4.

This plugins was created using the [Advanced Custom Fields field type template repository](https://github.com/elliotcondon/acf-field-type-template).  As such, there is a bunch of boilerplate code that is not currently used.
